# NYC Airbnb Listing Price Prediction
## Project Background
Airbnb has become increasingly popular when it comes to choosing accommodation for travelers.
Predicting the price for Airbnb listings is essential to the stakeholders who interact with the platform. 
On the one hand, renters can use the price prediction based on location, room type, and historical reviews to evaluate the actual listing price; they can additionally use the model to filter out overpriced listings. 
On the other hand, hosts who are considering posting their accommodations on Airbnb are able to cite the prediction from this model as a reference for their pricing attempts.
